    "## Exercise 4.1: \"Chunk size\"\n",
    "\n",
    "In the following, we continue working with the script for calculation Pi from lecture 3\n",
    "\n",
    "* Extend/revise the [monte_carlo_pi_2.py](monte_carlo_pi_2.py) script to measure the execution time for different choices of chunk size (L). Let $L = 10,100, ..., 1e6$. Keep the total number of trials $N*L = 1e7$, meaning that $N = 1e7/L$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Solution [here](monte_carlo_pi_2.py)\n",
    "\n",
    "* When using a single core P=1, which is the best chunk size to use? Hint: Plot using plt.semilogx(.)\n",
    "\n",
    "With P = 1, L = 1e5 gives an execution time of 15.8s, which is the best time.\n",
    "\n",
    "* When using multi-core, (e.g., P=8, if your machine has 8 cores), which is the best chunk size to use?\n",
    "\n",
    "With P = 12, L = 1e4 gives the best execution time, being 8.06s\n",
    "\n",
    "* Why is there a difference between these? Hint: try to imagine how the processes are allocated to the cores.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Exercise 4.2: \"Map filter reduce\"\n",
    "The purpose of this exercise is to become familiar with the map-filter-reduce programming method.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Single-core version:\n",
    "\n",
    "* As input data, we create N random integers on the interval 10-100. (Try first with low values of N)\n",
    "* Use the map, filter, reduce programming style to first subtract 7 from all values and then calculate the sum of all odd numbers. Use the python commands map, filter, and reduce, to achieve this, as introduced in the youtube video above."
